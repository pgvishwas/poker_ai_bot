# 🃏 Poker AI Bot

A machine learning-based Poker AI project that simulates Texas Hold'em games and explores strategies through both rule-based and ML-driven bots.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a functional, text-based poker engine (Texas Hold'em)
- Develop various poker-playing bots (random, rule-based, ML-based)
- Log game data for training machine learning models
- Predict opponent strategies based on past moves
- Explore reinforcement learning for bot training

## 🧠 ML Ideas (Coming Soon)

- **Opponent Strategy Predictor**: Predict player actions (fold, call, raise)
- **Poker RL Agent**: Train a bot using Q-learning or deep RL

## 🛠️ How to Run

To run a basic poker simulation:

```bash
python main.py
🧰 Tech Stack

    Python 3.x

    treys for poker hand evaluation (planned)

    NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn (for ML modules)

    TensorFlow/PyTorch (for future RL training)
